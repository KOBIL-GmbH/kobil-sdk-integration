# Trust Store Configuration

### Deciding on trust store content

Have a look at this example for a certificate chain used to identify an SSL/TLS server:
![](https://developer.kobil.com/assets/images/certchain-e3dbda953915eaa77244127631c84096.png)
At least one of the certificates MUST be present in your trust store. It is your choice which one it should be. If you put the "SSL certificate" for the called server into the trust store, you can *only* connect to specific servers matching that certificate. If you use "Intermediate CA 2", then any server with a certificate that has been signed by "Intermediate CA 2" is allowed. If you use "Root CA", then *all servers* that can show a certificate chain from the "Root CA" to their "SSL certificate" are allowed.

So, from the security point of view, it seems like using the "SSL certificate" would be the most secure option. However, there are two important drawbacks:

* This is not very flexible. If you change servers and end up needing a new "SSL certificate", this means that an app update is required.
* The further down you get in this image, the faster the certificate typically expires and when the certificate is expired, you again need to update the app to allow the new certificate.

So, in sum, you need to balance your desire for security with your need for flexibility and with the update frequency.

> **⚠️ Note**: In case of a server or CA transition or when a certificate is known to expire soon and the new certificate is already available in advance, multiple server or CA certificates might be present in the trust store, so they can be used in parallel. E.g. you could put both "Intermediate CA 2" and "Renewed Intermediate CA 2" into the trust store and you will be allowed to connect to any server with a certificate created by one of the CAs.

\*\* Note\*\*: Previously, we recommended another strategy for configuring the trust store. For the time being the old strategy will continue to work but it is deprecated and should not be used any more.

In practice, certificates missing in the trust store (e.g. due to server certificates changing over time) turned out to be a common issue. See the section [**common issues**](https://developer.kobil.com/docs/mcsdk-docs/common-issues/common-issues#tls-connection-errors) for some suggestions on how to deal with these problems when they occur.

### Details on truststore format

On the API level, the trust store is just a multi-line string containing one or more certificates in PEM format as known from OpenSSL's certificate stores that can be processed by `openssl storeutl`. To summarize, comment lines starting with the hashtag symbol (#) are ignored, marker lines reading "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----" or "-----END CERTIFICATE-----" mark the beginning and the end of a certificate and lines between those markers should contain a single certificate in base64-encoded form. So a possible truststore could look like this:

```

-----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

This would allow to connect to any server whose certificate has a chain going back to either the staging or the productive certificate of the Let's Encrypt organisation.

This format is used e.g. for the certificate parameter of the [CreateHttpCommonRequestEvent API](shift-lite-idpsdk__development__http-common-request.md) and also in `sdk_config.xml` or `sdk_config.jwt`, though for getting `sdk_config.jwt` signed by the server via cURL, you need to "translate" this to a slightly different format, as detailed on the page describing this file.

For the configuration files `app_config.json` and `mc_config.json` a slightly different strategy is used. Those files tend to be already quite unwieldy and may configure multiple servers each with their own trusted certificates entry which can either be completely different or all the same or overlapping with each other. So it seems more manageable to put the certificates
certificates into separate files (one or several certificates per file, depending on what makes most sense in your scenario) and just reference the file names in those configuration files. Therefore, the `trustedSslServerCerts` parameter should be set to an array of filenames, where each file needs to follow the formatting convention above.
